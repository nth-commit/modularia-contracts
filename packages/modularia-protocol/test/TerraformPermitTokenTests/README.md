# Terraform Permits

Terraform permits are an NFT that gives the holder one issuance of a land NFT. They are used to buy land, without needing to specify co-ordinates. They can be sold/transferred just like land is.

They auction contract has privledged rights for minting (associated with the current period ID), as well as the global DAO (though only for the initial airdrop, the DAO loses minting power after the airdrop is completed).

The map contract has priveleged rights for burning terraform permits. Users needn't give the map contract permission to burn.

Terraform permits can be minted with a lock time, which controls when the terraform permit NFT can be sold. Land minted with the permit inherits the lock time. The global DAO can set the lock time for a single land permit. This is useful for the initial airdrop to Founding Guardians, and also any land that is given via the Community and Inclusion Fund.

Do non-burned terraform permits count towards eras? I think so, as the revenue has been exchanged already. Perhaps they count entirely towards effective land supply, including burned terraform permits, excluding actual minted land?
